<p>Starting with a bit of history. The double-slit experiment, first ran back in 1801, demonstrates how light acts as waves by the unexpected formation of an interference pattern. It's simple enough that you can see this at home with a piece of paper, a flashlight, and a wall. Shine the light through just one slit onto the wall, and you'll see what you expect to see when you shine a light through a hole - a bright shape that matches the shape of the hole. Shine the light through two slits, and you see more than just two bright slits on the wall. You'll see a number of slits with regular intervals of darkness between them. This is the interference pattern.

<p>(It's not unlikely that people throughout history have been aware of the double-slit experiment. All it takes is a light source and slits that are narrower than the emitted wavelength of the light from the light source. Any civilization with access to paper and candles would have been able to perform the double-slit experiment. Further, I think it's worth noting that Richard Feynman has said about the double-slit experiment, "...[it] is impossible, absolutely impossible, to explain in any classical way, and which has in it the heart of quantum mechanics. In reality, it contains the only mystery.")

<p>It's worth knowing that if you use an experimental setup for the double-slit experiment that only emits one photon at a time with a detector on the other end, the accumulation of repeated runs will still show the interference pattern in the quantum probability wave. The photon, being a wave, goes through both slots and interferes with itself. When the photon hits the surface of the detector, its position becomes known, which collapses the probability wave to a random point on the wave. The distribution of these points over repeated runs is not a normal distribution; it shows the interference pattern. 

<p>Because of how quantum mechanics theorizes light to work, in 1965 Feynman proposed that if an observer could "watch" the individual photons as they went through the slits, the interference pattern would disappear. Feynman's argument was this - while the photons remained unmeasured, they would act like a quantum probability wave. This is what we see in the interference pattern - the two waves act destructively on each other and cancel each other out in certain areas to produce the visual effect. However, if we measured the photons such that an observer could tell which slot an individual photon went through, the quantum probability wave will have collapsed and the interference pattern will disappear. The act of percieving the photon is sufficent to cause the collapse.

<p>This is the Heisenburg's uncertainty principle in action. This is the end-game of Schrodinger's cat. By measuring the photon and becoming certain of something about it, the "which slot" superposition collapses. The interference pattern will disappear because the quantum probability waves are no longer waves.

<p>Feynman's hypothesis was intriguing, but no one would be able to rig up a way to actually test it until much later. The particular experimental apparatus I'm focusing on was done in 1999. It's a bit complex, so instead of explaining it, here's a picture. I'll be referencing this picture pretty heavily going forwards.

<p>To understand what's going on, starting at the top-left is a standard double-slit experiment. The red/blue coloring is for traceability of the photon paths; there aren't really photons of different colors coming down those paths. After the double-slit is a prism that splits the wave into two equal parts. One heads towards the top directly to a photon detector D0 that tracks the position of each photon.

<p>Prism PS causes the output of each slit to diverge so it can be measured seperately at photon detectors D3 and D4. Also of interest is the recombination of the slit outputs and measurement at D1 and D2. Note that we will know which slot a photon came out of when any output is detected at D3 or D4. However, this knowledge is lost when output is detected at D1 or D2; the photon could have come through either slot.  Also note that the outputs from D1, D2, D3, and D4 all also occur at D0. For example, we can know when a photon hits D3 and D0 because it will occur simultaneously (as long as the path lengths are the same, but more on that in a bit). 

<p>The experimental result is something I haven't been able to stop thinking about. As Feynman hypothesized, the photon output at D3 and D4 has no interference pattern at all, while the photon output at D1 and D2 do have the interference patterns. And D0? Remember that for each individual photon impact, we can know which detector it hit. When the photons at D0 could be tied back to photon output at D1 and D2, it also showed the interference patterns. When the photons at D0 were correlated with the photons at D3 and D4, they did not show the interference pattern. The photons at D0, through quantum entanglement, were collapsed from their probability waves and did not create an interference pattern when knowledge about which slot the photon went through could be known via the impacts at D3 or D4.

<p>It gets even crazier. The path to D0 is adjustable. It's a little bit less mindboggling to think about scenarios where the path to D0 is longer than the path to D1-4. The photon hits D1-4, and then the photon can "know" whether or not it was measured and hits D0 in the correct pattern. This also holds when the path to D0 is shorter - the photon hits D0 without "knowing" whether it's been measured or not, but it hits D0 in the correct pattern based on the hits on D1-4.

<p>And the part that can't just be explained by simple wave mechanics? Consider the entire output at D0. It's a combined output, similar to the outputs at D1 and D2. If there were just wave mechanics at play, with the easy "add two waves together to determine amplification and destruction effects" operation, then D0 would show the interference pattern, just like at D1 and D2. But there is no interference pattern at D0. This is surprising because there SHOULD be an interference pattern at D0. The output at D0 should be the same as the output of any double-slit experiment. However, the interference pattern at D0 is gone. 

<p>The photons can be observed. There is no interference pattern at D0 because the identification of which way a photon has come has been perserved. Granted, you can't know it directly just from D0, but we can know which slot a photon came through from the impacts at D3 or D4. It's important to note that if the path to prism PS is blocked, there is still no inteference pattern at D0. The optical mechanisms at prism PS and beyond have no wave mechanical effect on anything that happens at D0. The interference pattern is gone, not because the photons have or have not been observed, but because they can be.

<p>Note that just like there is no interference pattern in the entire output at D0, there is no interference pattern in the combined output of D1 and D2. The outputs at D1 and D2 are so perfectly out-of-phase that when considered seperately, you see the interference pattern, but when considered together, the interference pattern goes away (due to both constructive and destructive interference between the two of them). We've only seen the interference pattern disappear when "which slot" information is entangled with the photons. Is there some way still to extract "which slot" information from the combined photon impacts at D1 and D2?

<p>Yes, there is. If you follow the beams hitting D1 and D2 backwards, you'll see that all of them are headed out of beam splitter BSc. The beam inputs into BSc are the same as the beam inputs into D3 and D4, just phase-shifted a bit due to going through the beam splitters BSa and BSb. In other words, the information that you can get from the impacts at D3 and D4 could have also been obtained from the photons sent towards D1 and D2.

<p>And the interference pattern returns once the photons cannot be observed, as seen with the impacts at D1 and D2. These are the recorded impacts of waves before the detector itself forces a probability wave collapse to a single point. If these waves had collapsed prior to the detector, then the interference pattern would not exist (as we see in the impacts at D3, D4, and the correlated impacts at D0). The information exists, entangled in the split photons. When we take this bit of information out of the entanglement, an answer to seemingly the most minor question in the world - "which slot did this photon go through?", it is enough to collapse quantum probability waves and create a demonstrably different experimental result than the one you'd expect just from classical wave mechanics. That this information exists outside of entanglement is enough to make photons act like particles instead of waves.
